# Dimidium

Dimidium is a standard-looking color scheme, adjusted to have uniform visibility for all colors.

It aims to be a decent default for terminals.

## Crafting Dimidium

Dimidium was created by adjusting traditional color scheme. It solves the issues of default color schemes while preserving their essence.

### Color Appearance Model

Crafted with [CAM16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_appearance_model#CAM16), it considers the perceptual aspect(lightness, hue) of human color vision.

### Half lightness disparity

(Top: Before adjust / Bottom: Dimidium)

Reduced brightness difference ensures that all colors are easily visible. Fixed common problems of typical color schemes, such as blues being too dark and greens being too vibrant.

### Uniform hue difference

Hue differences were equalized to maximize color variation.

Introducing hue offsets between normal/bright colors ensures even better distinction.
